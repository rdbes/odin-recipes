<h1>Description</h1>
<p>"Pile 'Em Up" is a food item that the player can cook. The recipe for "Pile 'Em Up" is obtainable from Good Hunter for 5,000 Mora after reaching Adventure Rank 40. If the player has level 4 Reputation in Mondstadt, then the recipe will cost only 4,500 Mora.</p>

<p>Depending on the quality, "Pile 'Em Up" increases the party's critical rate by 10/15/20% for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in Co-Op Mode; this effect only applies to the player's party.</p>
    
<p>When Diluc cooks "Pile 'Em Up", there is a chance "Once Upon a Time in Mondstadt" will be created instead.</p>
